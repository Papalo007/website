    <p id="intro">There are a lot of options when it comes to internet browsers. However, some tend to have advantages over others. In the following article, you will get to learn the best browsers,
        along with their advantages and disadvantages. Below is a list of the programs that will be included in this article:

            <p>
                Most people need no introduction to the search behemoth's browser, Google Chrome. It’s attractively designed and quick at loading pages. Most website codes now target Chrome, so compatibility is seldom an issue. Chrome is available for all major platforms, and the mobile version offers syncing of bookmarks, passwords, and settings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Chrome doesn't have many unique browsing features, however, and it's the only browser included here that you won't find in the desktop app stores for macOS and Windows. There’s no built-in VPN, no cryptocurrency locker, no note feature, and no screenshot tool. Google has announced a feeble gesture towards adding a reading mode; feeble because it will only be in a sidebar, with the full, noisy distracting page still displaying in the main central browser window. The lack of a true reading mode makes sense for a company that earns its keep through web ads since reading modes hide them. All the other browsers here have full-page reading modes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Chrome allows multiple user profiles, meaning different users of the same computer can have their own browser settings, history, and favorites. The browser also finally caught up with others by adding a Share icon to the address bar that eases sending sites via social media or email.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A few years ago, Google controversially announced it would be removing the API function that allowed ad-blocker software to fully block ads. As of now, it seems ad blockers may be limited starting at some point in 2024. Some Chrome development, though, has centered around security and privacy, notably among them a plan to kill off tracking cookies in favor of Google's tracking mechanisms. The company's Privacy Sandbox initiative (in development) tries to cater to both ad targeting and user privacy. Some worry both of these developments will only result in more consolidation of the company's grip on web advertising and user profiling.

        <div id="edge">
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ" target="_blank"><h1>Microsoft Edge</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/edgeLogo.svg" class="logo" width="26%">
            <p>   
                The latest version of Microsoft Edge uses Chrome’s webpage-rendering code, Chromium, guaranteeing site compatibility and freeing up its developers to add unique features. You won’t run into the site incompatibilities users of the previous incarnation of Edge occasionally encountered, and the browser performs snappily. Edge now runs on Apple macOS and Windows 11 and earlier. Mobile versions for Android and iPhone let you sync history, favorites, and passwords.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Edge is a leader in performance, thrifty memory management, and disk usage. Startup Boost technology reduces the time it takes to open the browser, and sleeping tabs save memory on tabs you're not viewing. Edge's Efficiency mode can extend laptop battery life. The initial focuses for the browser were privacy, the customizable start page, and the intriguing Collections feature for web research. For enterprise customers who still rely on Internet Explorer to run legacy programs, Edge offers an IE Mode.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Collections feature uses a sidebar onto which you can drag webpages and images, write notes, and then share the whole assemblage to Excel, OneNote, or Word. It's a great organization and planning tool. Edge's Immersive Reader mode not only offers distraction-free web reading, stripping out ads and nonessential eye candy, but it can also read webpage text aloud using lifelike Neural Voices. It's worth trying because it reads with sentence intonation, rather than simply word by word, as we’ve come to expect text-to-speech audio.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Other notable Edge options include built-in web sharing, tabs down the side rather than across the top, a built-in screenshot tool, automatic coupons for shopping sites, and timely themes to dress up your browser. Recent additions include a side panel that integrates the new Bing AI chat search, game controller haptic feedback, and a multitasking side toolbar that lets you access first- and third-party services for social networking, search, messaging, search, and productivity.

        <div id="firefox">
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank"><h1>Mozilla Firefox</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/firefoxLogo.png" class="logo" width="27%">
            <p>               
                Firefox, an open-source project from the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, has long been a PCMag favorite. The browser has pioneered many web capabilities and the organization that develops it has been a strong advocate for online privacy. It’s also notable for its wealth of available extensions. The unique Multi-Account Containers extension lets you sequester multiple logins to the same site on different tabs. Without it, you'd have to open a private browsing window or another browser to sign out of all your web accounts and start a fresh session.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Mozilla’s browser is in the vanguard of supporting new HTML and CSS capabilities, and the company is working on open-source AR and speech synthesis standards. The organization now offers a full password management service called Lockwise, which can generate complex passwords, sync them between devices, and secure everything under a strong master password. That and the organization's VPN offering are paid extras.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The mobile Firefox apps offer excellent interfaces, and you can send a webpage tab from any device to any others that are logged into your syncing account. That’s right: You can be reading a webpage on your desktop PC, and have it instantly open on your iPhone or vice versa. It's a slick and useful feature.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If that’s not enough, Firefox has a Pocket button in the address bar, letting you save a page for later viewing anywhere with one click. The Reader View button declutters a webpage loaded with ads, promos, and videos, so you can peruse it with no distractions. PiP video supports closed captions and HDR and AV1 video formats. The browser is ultra customizable, letting you select and arrange buttons on the toolbar to taste, as well as select from a large number of Theme add-ons that change window border patterns and colors.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Recent additions include PDF editing and the Firefox View feature, basically a pinned tab of recent sites that syncs between the desktop and mobile versions of the browser.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="opera">
            <a href="https://www.opera.com/download" target="_blank"><h1>Opera</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/operaLogo.png" class="logo" width="27%">
            <p>             
                Perennially hovering around the 2% usage level, the Opera browser has long been a pioneer in the segment, inventing basic browser innovations like tabs, CSS, and the built-in search box. Opera can make a bigger privacy claim than the other browsers here—if you’re a believer in VPNs. It includes a built-in VPN (actually an encrypted proxy server) that protects and reroutes traffic from Opera to cloak your IP address. Opera uses the Chromium page-rendering engine, so you'll rarely run into site incompatibilities, and performance is fast. It's available for all major platforms, and the Opera Touch mobile browser is a beautifully designed app that connects (via quick QR scan) to your desktop.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Beyond the VPN, another unique feature in Opera is its built-in ad blocker, which also blocks crypto-mining scripts and trackers. Ad blocking also means less data consumed, especially of interest to those using metered connections or mobile plans with data caps.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                More unique features in Opera include its Speed Dial start and New Tab page, as well as its quick-access sidebar of frequently needed services like WhatsApp or Spotify. My Flow lets you send webpages and notes between devices easily. The browser also includes a video pop-out window, a Pinboard feature similar to Edge's Collections, and a Workspaces feature that lets you create function-based tab views. Opera uniquely offers a cryptocurrency wallet as an option, which supports most popular tokens.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Opera offers a gaming version called <a href="https://www.opera.com/gx" target="_blank">Opera GX</a>, and the company recently bought a gaming engine, moving into that specialty even further. The company also offers a futuristic secure Crypto Browser for navigating Web3. And like Edge, Opera is adding AI ChatGPT capabilities to the browser, starting with a summarizer tool for text you highlight or even full sites.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="brave">
            <a href="https://brave.com/download/" target="_blank"><h1>Brave</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/braveLogo.png" class="logo" width="26%">
            <p>
                Brave is a browser with an emphasis on privacy and ad-blocking, but at the same time, it lets you earn cryptocurrency while you browse. Like the majority of browsers these days, Brave relies on a customized version of Chromium, the code that powers Google Chrome, meaning it’s compatible with most websites. Brave has higher goals than simply letting you hoard crypto or even protecting your privacy. Its creators want to achieve a revolution in the way web commerce works, with direct micropayments taking the place of rampant ads. To earn cryptocurrency rewards with Brave, the software periodically pops up an unobtrusive ad in a box outside the browser window—you can turn it off if you prefer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The EFF’s Cover Your Tracks tool reports “strong protection against Web tracking.” A feature called Shields blocks third-party tracking cookies and ads by default. Brave forces the more secure HTTPS (something common among recent browsers) and lets you choose between Standard and Aggressive tracker-blocking and ad-blocking. Brave also has advanced fingerprinting protections that “randomize the output of semi-identifying browser features” and turn off features commonly used to sniff device info. In some brief tests, Brave and Tempest were the only browsers for which the EFF tool reported a randomized fingerprint. Brave has other security-minded products, such as a search engine, a private messaging app, and an initiative called SugarCoat, designed to thwart scripts that gather your browsing data while maintaining site functionality. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tor">
            <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" target="_blank"><h1>Tor Browser</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/torLogo.png" class="logo" width="29%">
            <p>
                The Tor (it stands for the onion router) browser’s slogan is, “Protect yourself against tracking, surveillance, and censorship.” It’s the ultimate in privacy protection in a browser, and the EFF’s privacy test reports “strong protection against Web tracking.” It provides a multistep encrypted route for your browsing that makes identifying you very difficult. It provides even more privacy than a VPN because your encrypted traffic goes through at least three nodes. The first node knows the source but not the destination of the traffic, the middle ones know neither, and the last only knows only the destination. This system makes it nearly impossible to trace traffic back to you. The downside? It slows down your browsing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you crank up Tor to its safest level of protection and disable JavaScript, a lot of common sites won’t run—basically anything that features interactive content, such as YouTube. Tor lets you access sites that use its own onion protocol that’s separate from the standard web, often called the dark web, in addition to providing privacy and access to the standard web. The EFF's Cover Your Tracks tool reports "strong protection against Web tracking" but that "your browser has a unique fingerprint." Changing the browser's privacy setting to Safest results in top protection for fingerprinting. That said, there's not much you can do on the web at that setting, since it disables JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                An even more private way to run Tor is through Tails, a lightweight operating system based on Ubuntu that you run off a USB drive. Tails doesn’t save any unencrypted data from your browsing session and leaves no traces on your computer’s drive.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="safari">
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari" target="_blank"><h1>Apple Safari</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/safariLogo.png" class="logo" width="30%">
            <p>            
                The default Mac and iOS browser is a strong choice, though its interface has some nonstandard elements. Safari was a forerunner in several areas of browser features. For example, it was the first with a Reading mode, which cleared unnecessary clutter like ads and videos from web articles you want to read. That feature debuted in 2010 and has made its way into all other browsers except for Chrome.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Apple has brought up the topic of fingerprinting protection—preventing web trackers from identifying you by your system specs. Unfortunately, the EFF's Cover Your Tracks test site only shows partial protection from trackers in Safari, while several competitors get a result of Strong protection. Other benefits include Apple Pay support and a "Sign in with Apple" feature to replace Facebook and Google as web account authorizers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In macOS Monterey, the browser gained a compact tab bar with floating tabs like Firefox's and Tab Groups that live in a convenient sidebar, and with Ventura, they become shareable and pinnable. Safari also supports Apple's proprietary Shared with You feature in its proprietary iMessage system. For iCloud+ subscribers, a Private Relay obscures your IP address, similar to a VPN.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you use an iPhone and a Mac, Safari integration makes a lot of sense, since Apple’s Handoff feature lets you continue your browsing session between devices. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="vivaldi">
            <a href="https://vivaldi.com/download/" target="_blank"><h1>Vivaldi</h1></a>
            <img src="./assets/vivaldiLogo.png" class="logo" width="30%">
            <p>
                Vivaldi, an offshoot of Opera that also uses the Chromium browser code, is the ultimate in customizability among browsers. It includes innovative features like built-in translation, split-window view, tab groups, notes, a link sidebar, and mouse gesture support. It now features Workspaces, which let you group related browsing sessions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Vivaldi includes built-in ad blocking and tracker blocking, though it doesn’t specifically attempt to thwart fingerprinters. As with the rest of the browser’s features, privacy settings are deep, broad, and granular, as you can see in the screenshot above. The EFF’s Cover Your Tracks test reported “strong protection against Web tracking” for Vivaldi with tracking protection on, though it still reported a unique fingerprint.

        <h1>What's the Best Web Browser Overall?</h1>
        <p>
            For the last several years, the browser landscape has been dominated by Google. The same company that serves more web content than any other (according to Comscore) also claims more than 65% of the worldwide browser market share with Chrome, based on StatCounter and W3Counter numbers. That’s for desktop use, but when you add in mobile, Chrome is still king. So dominant is Chrome that most other browsers now use its underlying Chromium rendering code, with Firefox the only remaining top-to-bottom independent competitor.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Chrome may be leading in usage (except, of course, on Apple devices), but it’s not ahead by every measure or by number of capabilities. Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera all have features not found in Google's browser. That’s not to say that Chrome isn't an excellent piece of software, but you should know that there are worthy alternatives. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Which Web Browser Is Best for Privacy?</h1>
        <p>
            Of the browsers listed here, Tor and Firefox are your best options for privacy, although if privacy is your main concern, there are also other browsers that could interest you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Privacy, customization, convenience features, tab and start-page tools, and mobile integration have replaced speed and standards support as today's primary differentiators. All browsers now can remember passwords for you and sync them (in encrypted form) as well as your browsing history and bookmarks between desktops or laptops and mobile devices. Chrome by default signs you into Google services like Gmail and YouTube, which some consider presumptuous.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Privacy mavens like to use virtual private networks, better known as VPNs, to hide browsing activities from ISPs and any other intervening entities between you and the site you’re visiting. Opera is the only browser here that includes a built-in VPN (Firefox offers one at extra cost). Firefox also has a good privacy story, with a private mode that not only discards a session’s history and cookies but also hides your activities from third-party tracking sites during the private session.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Firefox recently implemented DNS over HTTPS, which hides your web address lookups from your ISP. In addition, Edge, Firefox, and Safari include some fingerprint protection, meaning they try to prevent trackers from identifying you based on your hardware and software setup. One test of this is the EFF's Cover Your Tracks site, which reports the level of tracking protection; on that, Safari shows gaps, while Brave gets top marks. Some browsers also have built-in Content Blocking to fend off known trackers and cryptocurrency-mining ploys. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Which Web Browser Has the Best Tools?</h1>
        <p>
            Useful browsing tools can play a part in your decision, too. For example, Reading Mode strips webpages of clutter, such as ads and videos, so you can focus on text. Another is the Share button. With this era’s obsession with social media, it’s a nearly essential convenience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Opera is alone at the moment among the popular web browsers for having a built-in cryptocurrency wallet (the aforementioned Brave browser also has one). Opera is notable for its Speed Dial, which consists of pinned tiles on your home screen and a toolbar for accessing frequently needed services such as WhatsApp.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Microsoft Edge offers voice-reading of webpages with remarkably realistic speech, a helpfully customizable homepage, detailed privacy settings, and a Collections feature for web research. Firefox lets you instantly save a page to Pocket or open a new Container in case you want to be logged into the same site with two different identities. Screenshot tools are making their way into browsers, with Edge, Firefox, and Opera getting them for starters.
